# Econometrics - Project
## Analysis of Wine Price Determinants

## Description

### Aim
This project aims to check which determinants (Variables) in the dataset play the role on the price of the Wine. We perform a Linear Regression to check them. Furthermore, a few diagmostic tests are performed to check the performance of a linear regression model. 

### Data
Data is taken from Kaggle which includes features such as "rating", "num_reviews", "body", "acidity", "age", "region_dummy" adn our target variable "price".

### Models
We use Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to perform the analysis.
